+= is reassignment
numbers are immutable

arrays are mutable
a is a reference to an array.
the array contains three element each of which is itself a reference to a string object.
```ruby
>> a = %w(a b c)
=> ["a", "b", "c"]

>> a.object_id
=> 70227178642840

>> a[1] = '-'
=> "-"

>> a
=> ["a", "-", "c"]

>> a.object_id
=> 70227178642840
```
Several Array methods, such as #delete, #fill, and #insert mutate the original object without creating a new one.

the ability to modify arguments depends in part on the mutability or immutability of the object represented by the argument, but also on how the argument is passed to the method.

Some languages make copies of method arguments, and pass those copies to the method — since they are merely copies, the original objects can’t be modified. Objects passed to methods in this way are said to be passed by value, and the language is said to be using a pass by value object passing strategy.

Other languages pass references to the method instead — a reference can be used to modify the original object, provided that object is mutable. Objects passed to methods in this way are said to be passed by reference, and the language is said to be using a pass by reference object passing strategy.

Pass by value, as you’ll recall, means copying the original objects, so the original object cannot be modified. Since immutable objects cannot be changed, they act like Ruby passes them around by value. This isn’t a completely accurate interpretation of how Ruby passes immutable objects, but it helps us determine why the following code works like it does:

```ruby
def increment(a)
  a = a + 1
end

b = 3
puts increment(b)    # prints 4
puts b               # prints 3
```
